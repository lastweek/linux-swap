# We could have nice things about swapping

Swapping is kind of a hot topic these days.
Mainly because now there are couple trends that heavily rely on swapping:
1) container and virtualization, 2) remote memory.


At the time of starting this repo, I don't have a very good understanding
about the swap stack. Things I have in mind:
    - Learn the stack
    - Find bottelneck
    - Create a new generic layer that is solely for us-level swapping device

This is not a research project. I do this on my spare time.
